    "Title": "The essence of language-integrated query",
    "Abstract": "Language-integrated query is receiving renewed attention, in part because of its support through Microsoft ' s LINQ framework. We present a theory of language-integrated query based on quotation and normalisation of quoted terms. Our technique supports-tion over values and predicates, composition of queries, dynamic generation of queries, and queries with nested intermediate data. Higher-order features prove useful even for constructing first-order queries. We prove that normalisation always succeeds in translat-ing any query of flat relation type to SQL. We present experimental results confirming our technique works, even in situations where Microsoft ' s LINQ framework either fails to produce an SQL query or, in one case, produces an avalanche of SQL queries.
